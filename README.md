## Building static assets 

```sh
sh build.sh
```

Build Note that this will create a gzipped version of `rust-wasm-pong.wasm`. If you want to serve it locally, you'll need to present the file with the following headers, so that your browser can decode it. 

```
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: application/wasm
```

```sh
sh build.sh
```

## RRun locally:

```sh
cargo web start --release
```
